            This is a project in which we used maya to create our very own robots!, My idea was pretty simple I wanted

            create
            an abandoned robot left to rust away that something new was growing out of it (some sort of radiocative
            flower) Which I thought was super fun to learn as I have never used 3d modelling softwares

            <p class="lead text-center">Reflective essay – 
With my website I wanted to express some of my character with how  I styled it and the components I wanted to choose. I started off by designing it using Figma making sure to have a clear style between all my pages and It gave me a great start to help with what I actually wanted to make. In my Figma design I added sidebars that were spiderwebs giving a clear aesthetic to the website. Starting off with the html and css I did struggle with what I was to do but the more I delved into it the more simple it became to me. I can now say that with this practice I am able to create and understand a clear website using the bootstrap formatting. I started off by using the bootstrap worksheet as a starting point. I added my content and replaced the images and descriptions that were already there. This gave me a clear structure to build off as I was able to reuse the content I already had to add in more. I decided I wanted to add a navbar that was interactive to take you to different parts of a page, using the <sections> to make the buttons jump to each section that I created. We already had the navbar code but I made sure to change the format a little so it was more centered and so it always appeared at the top. I had to figure out how to prevent the over scroll effect using the css code I was able to change the over scroll behavior to none and make the over scroll hidden. I also wanted to add a bit of character to my text so I found code online that I used to create a rainbow gradient effect that creates an animation in my nav bar that changes the colours of each letter, going from all the colours in the rainbow, I also used the same colour and animation for the footer further pushing the overall aesthetic of the page. I did hit a wall with trying to add the sidebars for awhile, I went from first trying to get the image to duplicate all the way down the page. This created a multitude of problems and the code was getting a little to complicated, I made sure to get help with this and GiGi helped me understand the ideas of the fixed images, I discovered that with css I could set the side bar  images fixed to the sides and use the z index so it is put in the right place ! There are definitely some improvements to be made to my website but I think with what I have learnt and put into the creation this is a great structure to build off and I will be trying to add more into it in my free time as I have enjoyed the process put into it.
